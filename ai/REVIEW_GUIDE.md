# AI Code Review Checklist

When reviewing code generated by AI:

- [ ] **Hallucination Check**: Does the code use functions or types that do not exist?
- [ ] **Logic Check**: Walk through the control flow manually. Does it actually do what it claims?
- [ ] **Security Check**: Are capabilities correctly propagated? Are bounds checks present?
- [ ] **Style Check**: Does it match the project's strict formatting rules?
- [ ] **Complexity**: Is the solution over-engineered? AI tends to be verbose. Simplify it.
