# Security Policy

## Vulnerability Disclosure

We take the security of Athōn extremely seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, please do NOT open a public issue. Instead, encrypt your findings using our PGP key (ID: PLACEHOLDER_KEY_ID) and email them to security@athon.org. We aim to acknowledge receipt within 24 hours.

## Audit Policy

All code in `athon` is subject to mandatory manual review.

- **No External Code**: We do not blindly trust external libraries. Any code brought in must be audited line-by-line and vendored.
- **Capability Review**: Changes to `std/core` or `compiler/type-system` require sign-off from two security maintainers.
- **AI Generation**: Code generated by AI must be flagged and undergo a stricter "suspicion-based" review process.

## Reproducible Builds

Security relies on trust in the binary. We mandate reproducible builds.
To verify the integrity of the compiler:

1. Run `./ci/repro_build.sh` on a clean, air-gapped machine.
2. Compare the resulting SHA-256 hash with the published release hash.
3. If the hashes differ, the build is compromised.
